# Post Mortem
# JEDI - Unity 
## Approach and Process
### What in our process and approach to this project would we do differently next time?
* Doing things without properly discussing with my teammates. 
* More testing of the core market before design and features are chosen.


### What in our process and approach to this project went well that we would repeat next time?
* Deciding what is a priority and what is not helps our team to move forward in our project. Having a common understanding allows our team to work without much - conflicts. 
* Having fun with the team.

## Code and Code Design
### What in our code and program design in the project would we do differently next time?
* Organising SCSS files according to page instead of chucking it all into one random file and then having to sort it out later
* Probably less inline styling
* Properly dividing features in our team.

### What in our code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything we would do the same next time?
* Super duper fun CSS effects 
* Choosing to design for kids 
* Search for the rails gem before trying to build something new (e.g. Simple calendar gem)
* Having fun while we worked as a team!!!!!!!!111!!111!1!!!!! (Jasmine)
* We did what we wanted to do??? (David wanted to try out games API, Jasmine wanted to do calendars, Eden was MIA in the planning stage [I’m sorry!])


For each, please include code examples that each team member wrote.
Code snippet up to 20 lines.
Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.
